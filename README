----README

This code uses the library presented here: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master.
This code runs on the Raspberry Pi OS (Debian Bookworm). You should place this folder as a subfolder inside the repo folder.

So your project structure should be like

(...)/rpi-rgb-led-matrix (outermost folder)
|
+-.github, adapter, bindings, etc.
+-/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/TEST2 (folder that contains the special code and stuff)

----HOW TO RUN THE DEMOS FROM THE BASE REPO

cd /path/to/examples-api-use
sudo ./demo -D0 --led-no-hardware-pulse --led-cols=64

----HOW TO RUN THE STUFF IN THIS FOLDER

cd /path/to/THE_WITNESS
sudo ./main --led-no-hardware-pulse --led-cols=128

(do the commands [make clean] and then [make] to run the Makefile which will compile everything)

----SYSTEMCTL AND SYSTEMD

It is recommended to make a systemctl/systemd SERVICE that wraps around this code. 
That way you can run this code directly from a single service file call but also so you can have this run on startup.

Command to run the program:
	sudo /path/to/main --led-no-hardware-pulse --led-cols=128

How to reach the services folder:
	cd /etc/systemd/system
	sudo nano panels.service

How to link the service to the operating system and have it run on startup:
	cd /etc/systemd/system
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable panels.service

How to run the service manually:
	sudo systemctl start panels.service

How to kill the service:
	sudo systemctl kill panels.service

----SERVICE TEMPLATE

ExecStart is the command that is run in this case that is the main executable to play the animations on the matrices and whatnot.
